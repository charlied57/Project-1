Project 1
10/26/18

This project takes in values of any size and then adds them together. It stores these numbers per day and per 
week.  These values can be printed at any time by the user.  It also stores the max and min value of each day 
and week, and the day that had the larges change in entries.

All the inputs are strings and converted to int's if they need to be operated on.

Because of my limited knoledge on c++ and limeted experience programing this project is really ugly and messy.
There is a lot of repeted code that I would like to come back to at a later date when I have had more exposure 
to this language and programing in general.
